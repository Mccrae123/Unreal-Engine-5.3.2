Playstation 4 FTP site README 
====================================================

Welcome, Unreal Engine Playstation 4 developer!

Playstation 4 development currently requires a Windows computer along with
access to the Unreal Engine source code on GitHub.

This FTP site contains archives with the console-specific source files and
third party dependency files for Playstation 4.

Important:  Because GitHub has source code for various different releases of
Unreal Engine, the files on this FTP site will have different suffixes
depending on which build you're working with.  For example, if you've cloned
source for the 4.1.0 release, you'll want to download the PS4_4.1.0.zip file.

After downloading the appropriate file for the version of the engine you're
using, unzip it into your "UnrealEngine" root directory, similar to how
you'd unzip the various Required.zip files from GitHub.  Assuming your source
is in a pristine state, there should be no overlapping files between the
original release on GitHub.

After unpacking the files into your UnrealEngine source directory, you'll
find a simple "Getting Started" guide in the root folder named PS4.pdf.

Remember, Playstation 4 files are not to be shared with with Unreal Engine
subscribers who arenâ€™t also under console NDA or with the public.  Please
limit all discussion to the following Unreal Engine 4 forums, which are 
limited to registered developers of the appropriate platforms:

UE4 PlayStation 4 forum:

UE4 Xbox One forum:

Make sure to check out PS4.pdf after unpacking files for more information!
