			* Two different features need to move the viewport and need to work in combination with each other.
			* Ultra-high resolution rendering and single-frame anti-aliasing both work by moving the viewport
			* by a small amount to create new samples for each render pass which generates more usable data.
			*
			* High resolution rendering is referred to as "tiles" but it is not actually a tile based render.
			* Splitting the view into many smaller rectangles and using an off-center camera projection on them
			* wouldn't work due to post-processing effects (such as vignette) as you would end up with many copies
			* of the effect on your final image. Instead, it renders the entire screen for every 'tile', but shifts
			* the camera position a portion of a pixel to cause new, unique data to be captured in the next tile.
			*
			* Single-frame anti-aliasing works in a similar way, by shifting the view by less than a pixel for each
			* sample in the anti-aliasing. While the high-resolution rendering is a specific grid pattern, the
			* anti-aliasing uses a more nuanced technique for picking offsets. It uses a deterministic Halton
			* sequence to pick the offset, weighted by a Gaussian curve to mostly focus on samples around the
			* center, but occasionally picking an offset which would be a sample outside of it's current sub-pixel.
			*
			* In the example below we're looking at one render target pixel, split into a 2x2 tiling. To gain
			* 2x resolution, we shift the viewport so that the center of the pixel is no longer 'o', but now
			* 'v'. Since this shift is less than a whole pixel we can interlace the resulting images and they
			* won't be duplicates-but-shifted-by-one of each other. This is how we end up with new unique data.
			*
			* |-------------|-------------|
			* |        a    |             |
			* |    a        |             |
			* |      v      |      v      |
			* |   a         |             |
			* |a       a    |             |

			* |             |             |
			* |-------------|-------------|
			*
			* Now that a given render target pixel |v| has been shifted to it's correct location, we need to randomly
			* sample within that box (perhaps with a slight overshoot) for the anti-aliasing samples. These samples
			* ('a') are added together to create one |v| pixel and then only the |v| pixels are interleaved.
			* Interleaving is performed on the CPU to support > 16k output sizes which is the maximum texture resolution
			* for most GPUs.
