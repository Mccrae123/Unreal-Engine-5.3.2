===========

1.	Navigate to your project's **Source** folder. 

2.	Zip the **.sln** and its **Source** folder, and name it `<GitHubUserName>_<ProjectName>.zip`. 
	
	Note:  See `DocTeam_ExampleSnippetPrj.zip` for an example. 

3.	Submit the zipped file to this folder as a pull request.  
	
	Tip: For instructions on how to submit a pull request, learn about [Contributing to Unreal Engine](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/ContributingToUnreal/index.html).  

After submitting the pull request, we will review and comment (as needed) before accepting the code snippet.
