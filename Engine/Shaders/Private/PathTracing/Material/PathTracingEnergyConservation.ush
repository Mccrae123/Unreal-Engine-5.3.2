// We follow the terminology from [1]:
// Energy compensation: adjust individual BxDFs so that they have unit albedo from all viewing angles, compensating for (for example) the lack of multiple scattering in microfacet BxDFs
// Energy preservation: adjust the combination of lobes (such as diffuse+specular) to ensure we never create additional energy from any angle

// The suggested implementation in [1] is cumbersome for a GPU implementation because it requires table lookups during sampling to achieve low variance. We instead sacrifice reciprocity and
// simply divide the BxDF by its (tabulated/fit) directional albedo to enforce conservation of energy. We follow the approach outlined in [2] to account for spec/cloth and glass, and use
// the split-sum approach from [3] for the diffuse/specular energy preservation case (which generalizes to other lobes as well).

// USE_PATH_TRACING_ENERGY_CONSERVATION controls the implementation details of this file
//    0: disable conservation, all bsdfs are assumed to already have unit albedo from all viewing angles
//    1: use a small baked texture to store the directional albedo (and fresnel weighted albedo)
//    2: use an analytic approximation to directional albedo (doesn't require any textures to be bound and can be faster -- WIP)
