// This file is automatically generated by the console command r.InvalidateCachedShaders
// Each time the console command is executed it generates a new GUID. As this file is included
// in Platform.ush (which should be included in any shader) it allows to invalidate the shader DDC.
// 
// If you are merging streams and there is a conflict with this GUID you should make a new GUID rather than taking one or the other.
// GUID = 66906A4D-A1F5-4A5D-9AAB-70FFF8DB1805
