If you want to compile the WinDualShock plugin without needing the PS4 SDK installed, create a 
directory called NoRedist alongside this file and copy the include and lib directories from 
"%SCE_ROOT_DIR%\\Common\\External Tools\\libScePad for PC Games" into it and check them into your 
source control.
